This is a simple implementation of malloc, free, calloc, realloc.

Instructions to run:
run the make file

Known bugs/errors:
1. The testing filet-test1.c throws a segmentation fault. I am still looking
   into the issue.


Implementation details:
1. I had tried 3 different models and all the implementations threw segfaults.

a. I had taken arena as a struct which would store PAGE info.
b. In second model I had changed arena to just a (void *) as I could not understand the 
   the correct usage of TLS. I had implemented two lists here -- freelist and used list.
   which were initialised as a pointer to a block. But since, I could not store the
   values for intermediate pointers that were created, I had to scrap this model.
c. I tried writing the strcut block_t to the newly allocated memory and just maintaining
   the start addressof the memory in a list. But due to too many memcpy calls I had to
   scrap this model as well.

Lastly, I had implemented this model that I am submitting. It's very different from what I
had working last night. I had a subtle implementation with pointer and a proper linked list
implemented. It worked with both the cases test.c and t-test1.c
But it somehow started throwing segfault when I started to implement buddy allocation.

I will get the previous solution working and upload it to Github.
